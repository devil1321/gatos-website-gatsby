        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>We aim to make local and small  businesses a brand in themselves. Gastos educates small shopkeepers to get started with UPI and digital payments. At the same time we also help our users to pay anywhere and everywhere using Gastos. However, the catch here is getting discounts and rewards with almost every transaction you make.</p>
